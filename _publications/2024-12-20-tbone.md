## Lay Summary

Spaceflight leads to significant bone loss due to the absence of mechanical loading in microgravity. In this study, we tracked 17 astronauts during a 6-month space mission and followed their recovery over the course of a year back on Earth. Using high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) and biochemical bone turnover markers, we found that bone resorption during spaceflight greatly exceeded bone formation. While some recovery occurred postflight, many resorption cavities remained unfilled even after 12 months, suggesting that the skeletal self-repair process is incomplete and time-limited. Our results indicate a critical window in which countermeasures must support both formation and refilling of resorbed bone to maintain long-term skeletal health in space travelers.
