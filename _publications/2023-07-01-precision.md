## Lay Summary
Local mechanical forces in bone play an important role in bone health and adaptation. Evidence suggests that disruption of the process by which bones remodel themselves in response to forces may lead to bone loss. Combining a type of 3D bone imaging (HR-pQCT) with computational models shows promise for measuring this "mechanoregulation" process in people noninvasively. However, the techniques need further validation. This study developed methods using HR-pQCT scans in two groups - a "same-day" group to filter out image artifacts, and a "longitudinal" group scanned over 1+ years to track bone changes. We described bone remodeling events linked to mechanical stimuli using patient-specific odds ratios and graphs. We also calculated the rate of correctly identifying remodeling driven by mechanics. Finally, we determined precision - consistency of measurements over time. We found mechanics do regulate remodeling in consistent strain-dependent patterns across participants. Each 1% rise in strain made bone formation 1.9% more likely and resorption 2.0% less likely. Almost 40% of total remodeling followed strains. Our methods showed good precision between scan times. In summary, this work provides validated imaging markers and precision values to quantify bone mechanoregulation. These
